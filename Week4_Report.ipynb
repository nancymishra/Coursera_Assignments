People visit shopping malls to buy groceries, dine at restaurants, buy clothes and other fashion accessories and ofcourse watch movies. For kids it is a place to play games and enjoy. Shopping malls are like a one stop destination for everyone to spend some time. For retailers, the central location and a large crowd at the shooping malls provides a great distribution channel to market their products and services. Property developers also take advantage of this trend to build shopping malls where their is a huge demand.\nDelhi, being the Capital of India, has a lot of great shopping malls, and many are being built. Opening shopping malls allows property builders to earn consistent rental income."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## **Business Problem**"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "Opening a shopping mall is definetely not an easy task.
